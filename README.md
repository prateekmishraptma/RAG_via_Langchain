🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System using LangChain

An end-to-end implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built with LangChain that demonstrates how to create context-aware, reliable, and scalable LLM-powered applications.

This project showcases practical skills in building AI systems that retrieve relevant knowledge from external data sources before generating responses, enabling more accurate and grounded outputs.
